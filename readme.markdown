# redux-persist-to-localstorage [![travis-badge]][travis]

> A dead-simple redux store enhancer for adding `localStorage` persistance

## install

install the [package] with [`npm`][npm]:

```sh
$ npm install redux-persist-to-localstorage
```

## usage

```js
import persist from 'redux-persist-to-localstorage';
import {createStore} from 'redux';

const select = state => state.some.path.to.your.state;
const receive = (state, obj) => ({ ...state, ...obj });

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  initialState,
  persist('some-key', select, receive)
);
```

## api

### `persist(key, select, receive)`

creates a store enhancer that automatically persists whatever `select` returns.
the persisted object will be stored using `JSON.stringify` under `key`.
the object will be restored with `JSON.parse` and you can use `receive` to merge it with the (initial) state.
